# Nest.Js + React Pokedex

This project was designed and built as part of a technical assessment for a developer interview.

The assessment was to display a paginated view of pokemon using the PokeAPI with requests handled by a NestJs backend. Since the objective only specified displaying some basic infomration about each Pokemon (name, image, moves, etc ), I decided it would be fun to recreate the classic "Who's that Pokemon?" question game from the pokemon TV series.

## Running the Nest.js server

In the backend directory, you can run:

### `npm run start:dev`

Runs the server in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the server in the browser.

## Running the React front end UI

In the root directory, after running the server, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the server in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view the server in the browser.
